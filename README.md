# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems**, solved as part of my ongoing practice to strengthen **Data Structures & Algorithms** and problem-solving skills.

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to:
- Think clearly under constraints  
- Write clean, efficient code  
- Understand *why* a solution works, not just *that* it works
